# Summary
For study purposes I made a folder called docs where a put some topics that I was not fully oconfident about
So, if makes sense for you take a look at them:

This is the order that I like:
1. Installation
2. Controller 
3. Migration
4. Validator
5. Enum type
6. Mailer
7. Views and Templates
8. Authorization with redis

! middleware = permission
! controller = to call others
! metode = only one functionality
